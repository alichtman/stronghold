Library to easily read single chars and key strokes.

Goal and Philosophy
===================

Born as a `python-inquirer`_ requirement.

The idea is to have a portable way to read **single** characters and **key-strokes**.


Documentation
=============

Installation
------------

::

   pip install readchar

The :code:`readchar` library is compatible with python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3.

Usage
-----

Usage example:

.. code:: python

  import readchar

  c = readchar.readchar()
  key = readchar.readkey()

API
----

There are just two methods:

:code:`readchar()`
//////////////////

Reads the next char from :code:`stdin`, returning it as a string with length 1.


:code:`readkey()`
/////////////////

Reads the next key-stroke from :code:`stdin`, returning it as an string.

A key-stroke can have:

- 1 character for normal keys: 'a', 'z', '9'...
- 2 characters for combinations with ALT: ALT+A, ...
- 3 characters for cursors: ->, <-, ...
- 4 characters for combinations with CTRL and ALT: CTRL+ALT+SUPR, ...

There is a list of previously captured chars with their names in :code:`readchar.key`, in order to be used in comparations and so on. This list is not enough tested and it can have mistakes, so use it carefully. Please, report them if found.


SO Support
----------

Sadly, this library has only being probed on GNU/Linux. Please, if you can try it in another SO and find a bug, put an issue or send the pull-request.

Thank you!

How to contribute
=================

You can download the code, make some changes with their tests, and make a pull-request.

In order to develop or running the tests, you can do:

1. Clone the repository.

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/magmax/python-readchar.git

2. Create a virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

   virtualenv venv

3. Enter in the virtual environment

.. code:: bash

   . venv/bin/activate

4. Install dependencies

.. code:: bash

    pip -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

5. Run tests

.. code:: bash

    make


Please, **Execute the tests before any pull-request**. This will avoid invalid builds.
